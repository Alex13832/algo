Sorting Algorithms
================================

### Bubble Sort * Slow *
Good for a small amount of items. Very slow for large input size.

### Heapsort
Divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving tha to the sorted region.

### Insertion sort * Slow *
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the unsorted list, finds the location where it should be inserted and inserts it.

### Merge Sort
O(nlogn) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Divide and conquer algorithm.

### Quicksort
A divide and conquer algorithm. The algorithms divides the array into two smaller arrays and then recursively sorts them.
