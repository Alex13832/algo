Sorting Algorithms
================================

### Heapsort
Divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving tha to the sorted region.

### Quicksort
A divide and conquer algorithm. The algorithms divides the array into two smaller arrays and then recursively sorts them.
