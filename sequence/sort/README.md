Sorting Algorithms
================================

### Bubble sort
Good for a small amount of items. Very slow for large input size.

### Bucket sort
Distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets, then puts back the elements in the input array and finally makes an insertion sort.

### Gnome sort
[Gnome sort on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort)

### Heapsort
Divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving tha to the sorted region.

### Insertion sort
Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the unsorted list, finds the location where it should be inserted and inserts it.

### Merge sort
O(nlogn) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Divide and conquer algorithm.

### Quicksort
A divide and conquer algorithm. The algorithms divides the array into two smaller arrays and then recursively sorts them.
