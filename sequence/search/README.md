Search and Sort Algorithms
======================================

### Binary Search
Finds the position where the object is located. The algorithm begins by comparing the target value of the middle element of the sorted array. If the middle element is equal to the object then the position of the the middle element is returned. If object is less than the middle element, the algorithm will searh in the lower part and analogously if the object is larger than the middle.

### Linear Search
Finds the element by iterate through the list until the element is found. Can be used on unsorted list for instance.

### Selection Algorithms
Finds the kth smallest/largest element(s) in a sequence.
