Graph Algorithms
=================================

### Bellman-Ford
Computes the shortest from a source vertex s to all the other vertices in a weighted directed graph. It does the same job as Dijkstra's algorithm, but it can handle negative edge weights. Thus it's more versatile.

### Breadth First Seach (BFS)
BFS is an algorithm for graph/tree traversing/searching. The traversing starts at a given node and explores the neighbors before moving to the next level. See the example below.
