String Algorithms
===============================
Contains mainly algorithms for finding sub-strings in some input string.

### Bitap algorithm
An approximate string matchin algorithm. It basically finds if a piece of text is a substring of another piece of text.

### Boyer-Moore Algorithm
An efficient string searching algorithm. This implementation is slightly modified, it finds all occurrences of a substring.

### Crossword dictionary
A program that produces a dictionary that can be handy when solving crosswords. The words are sorted are first reveresed then sorted and then reversed again.

### Longest Common Substring
This algorithm finds the longest common substring between two strings using dynamic programming.

### Rabin-Karp Algorithm
A string searching algorithm that finds all occurences of a chosen string in a piece of text. There is support for both single word and multi word search.
