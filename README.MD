Algorithm
===============================
This repository contains implementations of various known algorithms from selected fields of algorithm design in computer science. The README files are written as a basic tool that can be used to quickly understand what kind of algorithms are implemented.  

## Constraints
Only the C++ standard library, std. No Boost or additional libraries.

## Resources

### Data
For generating and plotting data, the [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si) data mining tool is used. It's super easy to 
output a data set in csv format to play with. The result of the C++ algorithms may then be plotted with the 
same tool. Not a single line of code.

### Unit testing
The C++ code is tested with the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework.
