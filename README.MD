Algo :rocket:
===============================
This repository contains C++ implementations of various known algorithms from selected fields of algorithm design

* Data mining
* Computational geometry
* Graph theory
* Greedy algorithms
* Image analysis and computer vision
* Network algorithms
* Puzzle solving
* Searching
* Sequence
* Sorting
* Strings
* Transforms

## Constraints

The algorithms are implemented **only** using the C++ standard library.

The examples in `examples/` may use additional libraries but should not be required when building the library itself.

## Resources

### Documentation :paperclip:

See the `doc` folder for documentation. The plots in the documentation has been generated with python and [Plotly](https://plotly.com).

### Data
Most of the test data has been generated thanks to the [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si) data mining tool.

### Examples

See the `examples` folder for examples. To run some of the examples, OpenCv is required.

### Unit tests :white_check_mark:
The C++ code is tested with the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework.
